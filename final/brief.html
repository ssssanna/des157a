            <h3>Project summary</h3>
            <p>For my final project, I plan to extend the <a href="../studio2/index.html">Every Picture</a> project by focusing on iterating the user experience and visual design aspects of it.</p>

            <h3>Project description</h3>
            <p class="pd">Firstly, my intention is to include a homepage that greets and introduces the main purpose of the page to users. It will feature smooth animations to enhance visual interactivity. Moreover, the main page will showcase 1-2 additional Lego collections, and I plan to enrich the content of the overlays by demonstrating personal connections with each Lego set to enhance the storytelling aspect.</p>

            <p class="pd">In terms of visual design, additional graphical elements and a new design system will be added to improve the siteâ€™s interface design. A logo and a site name will be developed to enhance the layout integrity. The visual design iteration aims to focus on including more user-friednly details, such as better visual contrast, to more efficiently communicate the idea and story of each collection to the audience.</p> 
                
            <p>For UI/UX, further development of the project will revolve around the intention of creating a more effective and intriguing experience for users. The click-to-zoom feature for each collection will be maintained with the additional feature of highlighting each clickable character/object to increase user interactivity. Other interactive elements may be added to engage the audience more. This aspect particularly focuses on refining the navigation process for users.</p>

            <h3>Expert feedback</h3>
            <p>I plan to reach out to Sky or Nikita and my other design professor to share my ideas for visual design. I believe their valuable insights and professional feedback will help me iterate and enhance my project. For usability testing, I intend to ask Nikita or Sky as well as a few of other people, including a design professor, a friend who is not in the UI/UX industry, and someone who is also passionate about Lego. I think feedback from a variety of users will provide more comprehensive views regarding their experience with the page.</p>
