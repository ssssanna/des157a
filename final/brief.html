            <h3>Project summary</h3>
            <p>For my final project, I’m going to extend the <a href="#">Every Picture</a> project while focusing on iterating user experience and visual design aspects.</p>

            <h3>Project description</h3>
            <p>Firstly, I plan to include a homepage that introduces the main intention of the site. It will serve as a page that provides a brief background story while guiding users to navigate through the content. I’m also going to include 1~2 more Lego collections which helps to enrich the “Every Picture” theme. 

            In terms of visual design, more images, graphical elements, and a new design system will be added to improve the site’s interface design. A logo and a site name will be developed to enhance the layout integrity. A banner will also be included on the homepage with a call to action button for users. The visual design iteration will focus on including more elements to better communicate the idea of the site as well as of each collection page to the audience. 
                
            For UI/UX, further development of the project will revolve around the intention of creating a more effective and intriguing experience for users. The click-to-zoom feature for each collection will be maintained with the addition of highlighting each clickable character/object to increase interactivity. Other interactive elements, such as buttons, will also be added to engage the audience more. This aspect particularly focuses on refining the navigation process for users.</p>
