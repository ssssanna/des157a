            <h3>Visual Design</h3>
            <p class="pd">For iterations of visual design, I decided to use a color scheme of black and red, which echoes part of the Lego logo. The black and red also create strong visual contrast for better information display. Font choices of ‘Lora’ and ‘Fugaz One’ aim to strengthen visual hierarchy. Moreover, in terms of page layout, I included a header banner, sections that briefly introduce each Lego set to users, and more images to expand the page content vertically. I intend that through vertical scrolling and effective information layout, users will be able to easily navigate through the site and enjoy the storytelling. Compared to the initial Every Picture project, the improved visual designs for the final project enhance the narrative aspects by adding more information and visually appealing arrangements for the additional content. The overlays are also updated by giving each a white background where each character is shown. Iterations for visual design focus on simplicity and legibility for a more attractive visual experience.</p>

            <h3>User Interface/User Experience</h3>
            <p class="pd">My iterations for the UI/UX aspect of the final project are to enhance visual hierarchy and maintain a consistent design throughout. As mentioned above, font choices and content layout are carefully considered to create a better browsing experience for users. The intended audience for this site is anyone interested in Lego collections and/or anyone interested in exploring the content in general. Therefore, the site is designed to have a fluent storytelling structure and context for the audience. Overlays when clicking on a character are updated as well. Instead of a dialogue box appearing, when users click on a character, the image zooms in, and an overlay slides in from the right. Each overlay features the corresponding character and a phrase they would say according to their characteristics in the show/movie. This feature allows for user interactivity which engages them more.</p>
