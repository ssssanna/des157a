            <h2 class="articleh2">Best Practices for Web Overlays</h2>
            <p class="articledate">October 19, 2023</p>

            <p>In <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">“Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows,”</a> Naema Baskanderi shares several guidelines and principles that designers should follow when including overlays on a web page. Baskanderi stresses that the goal of including an overlay is to emphasize specific content, present additional information, or highlight a call to action for users. According to the author, it is essential that the overlays are included on the web page for a purpose that helps exhibit the content more effectively.</p>

            <p>In addition, I find it useful when the author points out a key point that designers need to pay attention to while designing overlays keyboard accessibility. The Accessible Rich Internet Applications that Baskanderi briefly mentions near the end of the article are also interesting. The article, moreover, provides some inspirations and guidelines that I could incorporate into my MadLibs project, for example, keyboard accessibility, button labels, and modal size. After reading the article, I understand more about designing overlaps for web pages and the functionality of it.</p>

            <h2 class="articleh2">Form design for web</h2>
            <p class="articledate">October 15, 2023</p>

            <p>In <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">“Best practices for form design,”</a> Salim Ansari emphasizes some of the most important points and considerations when designing forms for web pages. He highlights that it is essential for designers to understand users’ needs and concerns, and to sympathize with users to help develop a better form design structure that is friendly and easy to use. This article is informational and provides some useful guidelines for designers to follow.</p>

            <p>Filling out forms can be frustrating, especially when I find that many digital forms lack a progress indicator, drastically reducing users’ enthusiasm and patience. When users don’t have a clear vision of the progress of entering information, they don’t know how many questions are left, and that can discourage people from finishing the forms in one setting or completing the forms. Ansari discusses some of the solutions to this problem in the article, which include providing a progress indicator to users, dividing the form into sections or pages, organizing the input fields vertically, and so on. The author also stresses that accessibility and reducing cognitive load for users are essential points that need to be taken into consideration when designing forms, and I think they are central principles to follow not only for form designs but also for web design or web development in general.</p>

            <p>Although the <a href="https://www.delta.com/flightsearch/book-a-flight">“Book A Flight”</a> form in the Fly Delta mobile app is certainly not a perfect form that nothing can be improved on, I think its design exemplifies some of the best practices mentioned in the article. The design of the form is short and the interface is easy to navigate. Drop-down menus, icons, arrows, + and - buttons, and checkboxes are used to guide users through the filling process. “I” icons are also included that users can click on to get more detailed explanations and information about certain inputs, such as “Refundable Fares Only.”</p>
