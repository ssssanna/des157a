            <h2 class="articleh2">Game Design and UX</h2>
            <p class="articledate">November 7, 2023</p>

            <p>In <a href="https://uxplanet.org/game-design-ux-best-practices-guide-4a3078c32099">“Game Design UX Best Practices,”</a> Amir Dori shares some of the “best practices” that can be applied in the user experience aspect for game design. I find the article interesting as it points out a lot of elements and micro-interactions that I have never paid attention to in games that I play but, as the author explains, they help to construct a more engaging interface and experience for users. For example, partially displaying content on the screen suggests that there is more if you scroll, which effectively storing more information on the page while enhancing interactivity from the users. The author also introduces the concept of monetization, where content/buttons are placed on the screen within comfortable reach for the consumers so it becomes easy to click on them which leads to ads, shops, etc. </p>

            <p>Another thing that I find intriguing in the article is when Dori mentions the importance of animated presenters and how their visual presentations could affect users’ behaviors. Cartoon-style characters are often seen in games to represent the users as players. Dori emphasizes that how they are placed on the screen, and more importantly, their eye contact with users in reality, generates a positive effect that engages the users to interact with the game more. I think that is an approach which is so subtle, at least to me, to be noticed and think deeply about it yet it effectively benefits the games.</p>

                    <img src="./images/archive_image.jpg" alt="an image showcasing a lake at Rocky Mountain National Park" width="250" height="300">

            <p>I took this image in 2019. It is meaningful and interesting because it showcases a unique perspective while bringing back memories and emotions. It was the summer before COVID shut down the entire world, my family and I went on this long road trip from Colorado to Las Vegas. Rocky Mountain National Park was one of our first destinations, and this lake was a scenery that we stumbled upon during our visit to the park. The vibrant colors, the viewpoint, and the textures shown in the image remind me of my family and the mood at the time. My archive’s topic is “A road trip from Denver to Las Vegas,” and this image captures a glimpse of the trip. My archive intends to be a photo collection that tells the story of this adventure, and this photo represents the start of our journey in some way. Moreover, the archive will be organized in chronological order. By using text to narrate the story of each photo in a diary-like format, I hope to convey an appreciation for nature and the courage to explore the unknown through this archive.</p>

            <h2 class="articleh2">Every Picture Part II</h2>

            <p>Callia’s image seems like it’s showing a page within a detective-themed pop-up book. There is a lot of information presented, including notes, a ticket to a charity ball, letters, and so on. Information is included in the page in various forms to provide clues or hints to readers. The most interesting aspect of this image is its expressions and the emotions generated. The color scheme, the content, and the layout directly convey the theme to the audience. Texts are organized into various designs and engage the readers to interact with them. The most obvious aspect of this image is its theme, which is solving a case. The mysterious part is if any of these elements in the image are interactive, what is the story that drives this book, and what is the story behind this book?</p>

            <h2 class="articleh2">Visual Thinking Strategies</h2>
            <p class="articledate">October 25, 2023</p>

            <p>In <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">“10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills”</a> by Michael Gonchar, the author discusses ten methods that can be used in teaching and practicing visual thinking strategies. One of the methods stands out to me when Gonchar mentions that we can also utilize visual thinking strategies in other subjects/fields. The three questions are simple yet they provide an opportunity for students and audiences to expand their knowledge and perspectives. I often hear “close reading” in writing courses or courses that require us to read academic work. While the idea of closely examining and analyzing a piece is similar, the medium and the materials involved are different. Visual thinking, to some extent, not only enables audiences to study and observe the content presented by the medium but also allows them to share their thoughts to further develop a more comprehensive understanding of the work. Through following the article, I was able to understand the functions of visual thinking strategies more.</p>

            <p>Moreover, I find that the <a href="https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/our-history/">Google Search website</a> utilizes a compelling and fascinating visual storytelling strategy to present its history to the viewers. Through applying graphics, illustrations, images, overlays, a horizontal scroll bar, and other interactive elements, the page vividly engages the audience to interact with the content while encouraging them to read the information. The interactive timeline shown inspires me to consider how to organize and exhibit the information in a way that promotes visual thinking so that viewers can ask and answer the three questions while going beyond the superficial content.</p>

            <h2 class="articleh2">Best Practices for Web Overlays</h2>
            <p class="articledate">October 19, 2023</p>

            <p>In <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">“Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows,”</a> Naema Baskanderi shares several guidelines and principles that designers should follow when including overlays on a web page. Baskanderi stresses that the goal of including an overlay is to emphasize specific content, present additional information, or highlight a call to action for users. According to the author, it is essential that the overlays are included on the web page for a purpose that helps exhibit the content more effectively.</p>

            <p>In addition, I find it useful when the author points out a key point that designers need to pay attention to while designing overlays keyboard accessibility. The Accessible Rich Internet Applications that Baskanderi briefly mentions near the end of the article are also interesting. The article, moreover, provides some inspirations and guidelines that I could incorporate into my MadLibs project, for example, keyboard accessibility, button labels, and modal size. After reading the article, I understand more about designing overlaps for web pages and the functionality of it.</p>

            <h2 class="articleh2">Form design for web</h2>
            <p class="articledate">October 15, 2023</p>

            <p>In <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">“Best practices for form design,”</a> Salim Ansari emphasizes some of the most important points and considerations when designing forms for web pages. He highlights that it is essential for designers to understand users’ needs and concerns, and to sympathize with users to help develop a better form design structure that is friendly and easy to use. This article is informational and provides some useful guidelines for designers to follow.</p>

            <p>Filling out forms can be frustrating, especially when I find that many digital forms lack a progress indicator, drastically reducing users’ enthusiasm and patience. When users don’t have a clear vision of the progress of entering information, they don’t know how many questions are left, and that can discourage people from finishing the forms in one setting or completing the forms. Ansari discusses some of the solutions to this problem in the article, which include providing a progress indicator to users, dividing the form into sections or pages, organizing the input fields vertically, and so on. The author also stresses that accessibility and reducing cognitive load for users are essential points that need to be taken into consideration when designing forms, and I think they are central principles to follow not only for form designs but also for web design or web development in general.</p>

            <p>Although the <a href="https://www.delta.com/flightsearch/book-a-flight">“Book A Flight”</a> form in the Fly Delta mobile app is certainly not a perfect form that nothing can be improved on, I think its design exemplifies some of the best practices mentioned in the article. The design of the form is short and the interface is easy to navigate. Drop-down menus, icons, arrows, + and - buttons, and checkboxes are used to guide users through the filling process. “I” icons are also included that users can click on to get more detailed explanations and information about certain inputs, such as “Refundable Fares Only.”</p>
